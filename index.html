            <p>
                I am a dedicated and hardworking blockchain developer who fully invests his time
                into learning everything about the technology and building blockchain software.
                My goal is to help my clients by teaching them about blockchain technology,
                developing a software solution that leverages the power of blockchain, and guiding
                them through the entire process.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can learn anything and I can learn it fast. I am highly adaptable and can form to
                fit any project role or need. I believe that communication is essential to the
                successful and timely development of a project. I pride myself on producing only the
                highest quality of work for my clients.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been developing software for 4 years. I am currently a senior Computer Science
                student at the University of Maryland, College Park (ranked 16th in the United States
                for Computer Science). I have interned at Grafiti, a technology startup focused on
                sharing legitimate, verified data. I have worked as a freelance web developer,
                building websites for several companies and individuals to upgrade their online presence.

            <p>
                A small scale blockchain for the purpose of teaching blockchain core fundamentals.
                The blockchain is secured through the SHA-256 hash algorithm and uses Elliptic Curve
                Digital Signatures on the secp256k1 elliptic curve (the same technology stack used
                to secure Bitcoin). The protocol also generates valid Bitcoin public / private
                addresses.

            <p>
                A data science tutorial to walk readers through the data science life cycle while
                also teaching them about the technologies behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin,
                Ethereum, and Ripple. A webscraper is used to gather cryptocurrency price data from
                the internet which is then used to develop a machine learning model using linear
                regression.
